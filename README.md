# ocm-checkin-app
This is an application for OCM <https://www.ocmchurch.org/en> to make their registration process easier. It will allow phone number authentication with firebase, then will display their QR codes based on a postgres database. 

In the future this app may become the official app of OCM, and will no longer only provide support for login and registration.

Initially was meant to be an Android/ios app, but made into a web application. An android/ios version will be released if the app receives positive feedback from church members.

## Technologies Used: 
- React JS (Native)
- Firebase
- PostgresSQL
- I used a library called React global states, in the future I will probably use something like redux toolkit instead.
