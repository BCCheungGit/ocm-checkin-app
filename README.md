# ocm-checkin-app
This is an application for OCM <https://www.ocmchurch.org/en> to make their registration process easier. It will allow phone number authentication with firebase, then will display their QR codes based on a postgres database. 

In the future this app may become the official app of OCM, and will no longer only provide support for login and registration.

## Technologies Used: 
- React JS (Native)
- Firebase
- PostgresSQL
- I used a library called React global states, in the future I will probably use something like redux toolkit instead.


### Things to add:
- [x] Registration Page
- [x] Photo Upload
- [x] Camera Access Request
- [x] Translate Welcome Page
- [ ] Add QR Codes
- [ ] Congifure and connect to posgres database (I currently do not have access)
- [ ] Release the app (app store and google play)
- [ ] Organize code, add comments, make it more readable (in case future church members want to update the app)
